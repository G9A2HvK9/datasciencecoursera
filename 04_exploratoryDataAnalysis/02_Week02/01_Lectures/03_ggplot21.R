## GGPLOT2 - PART 1

## Implements 'Grammar of Graphics' by Leland Wilkinson
## Written by Hadley Wickham

## "The grammar tells us that a statistical graphic is a mapping
## from data to aesthetic attributes (colour, shape, size) of geometric
## objects (points, lines, bars). The plot may also contain statistical
## transformations of the data and is drawn on a specific coordinates system."

## works much like the base plotting system - qplot = quickplot
## looks at data in table
## made up of aesthetics and geoms

## Factors become important to indicate subsets of your data
