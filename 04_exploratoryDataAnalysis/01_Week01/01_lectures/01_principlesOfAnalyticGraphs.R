## Rules for how you tell stories through data
## Book: Beautiful Evidence by Edward Tufte

## 1. Principle: Show Comparisons
## Evidence is always relative <- 'compared to what??'
## Effect of air cleaner on astha sympoms <- 'compared to what??'

## 2. Principle: Show causality
## Tell a story about how the world works, according to your data
## Effect of air cleaner on asthma syomptoms <- Effect of air cleaner on particulate matter
## Effect of particulate matter on asthma symptoms reduced through air cleaner

## 3. Principle: Show multivariate data
## Life is inherently multivariate <- more data tells a more holistic story
## Important to show as many variables as is reasonable in your data, so you can get a clear picture

## 4. Principle: Integration of Evidence
## Integrate words, numbers, images, any source of informative data
## Your data presentation is presentation of evidence. You tell a story
## Anything that helps you tell the story is good
## Don't let your tools dictate your presentation

## 5. Principle: Describe and Document Your Evidence
## Credible evidence tells a more credible story
## Lend credibility to your evidence by documenting and describing your sources
## Include direct sources, computer code etc

## 6. Principle: Content is King
## No matter how good your graph, a bad story is boring
## Interesting data or an interesting question is key

## All principles:
## 1. Show comparisons
## 2. Show causality / a mechanism
## 3. Show multivariate data
## 4. Integrate multiple modes of evidence
## 5. Describe and Document the Evidence
## 6. Content is King
