# dplyr is about working with data frames
# 1 column 1 variabel
# 1 row 1 observation

# optimized and distilled version of the plyr package
# greatly simplifies the existing R architecture

# select: return subset of columns from a data frame
# filter: return subset of rows from a data frame based on logical conditions
# arrange: reorder rows of a data frame
# rename: rename variables in a data frame
# mutate: add new variables or columns or transform them
# summarise: generate summary statistic of diferent variables in the data frame

# dplyr functions are arranged according to similar or same format
# first arg: is the data frame
# subse args: describe how to treat the data frame
# you can use the variable names from the data frame directly! no quotes or subsetting needed
# results in a new data frame
# input data frames need to be formatted well for this to be useful
